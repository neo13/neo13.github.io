# Qui Ãªtes-vous?

My name is Aaron. I'm a computer scientist, researching as a graduate student in University of Alberta, and that's that. But that's just a persona, a social contract which is, at best, a fragmentary response to the question, "who are you?"

Here though, I'm not trying to live up to my persona, my social label. Here, in my own stupid and moronic way, I'm trying to express the those layers of my self which I constantly suppressed in order to maintain that persona.

This is not a computer science blog, nor is it dedicated to any other sort of specific subject. It's just a raggedy collection of unrelated non-sense created by a hallucinating mind.
