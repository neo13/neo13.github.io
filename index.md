# je m'appel

My name is Aaron. I'm a computer scientist, researching as a graduate student in University of Alberta, and that's that. But that's just a persona, a social contract which is, at best, a fragmentary response to the question, "who are you?"

Then who am I? a grad student, a computer scientist, an amateur photographer or an independent film maker? As the matter of fact I'm neither of those, they are merely labels for some of the things that I do, none of them defines me or gives meaning to my existence. If you ponder the aforementioned question, again and again, you'll see that every answer you'd come up with is unable to provide an effective and meaningful response. I seems like all those little things that you so simple-mindedly considered as part of "who you are" are absolutely irrelevant.

I don't know who I am. Perhaps I would find out someday, perhaps not. How about you, who are you?
