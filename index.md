# Qui Ãªtes-vous?

My name is Aaron. I'm a computer scientist, researching as a graduate student in University of Alberta, and that's that. But that's just a persona, a social contract which is, at best, a fragmentary response to the question, "who are you?"

It's not important who am I and to be totally honest I don't even know it myself. That is probably the reason for which I hate how everybody like to introduce themselves with their job, hobbies, accomplishment and what not.

I don't even know why anyone would like to know anyone else but if you do make sure that you already know what are you looking for.
